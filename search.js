Your site has pages that aren&#8217;t easily discoverd by Googlebot during the crawl process-for example, pages featuring rich AJAX or images.  Your site is new and has few links to it. (Googlebot crawls the web by following links from one page to another, so if your site isn&#8217;t well linked, it may be hard to Google to discover it.)ConclusionFollowing this post&#8217;s tips and guideline, you can increase your website&#8217;s organic search impression and more visitors will visit your site."

But in long term, you will see the benefits.### Last Choice![Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation](/img/posts/bootstrap-fundation.png Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation)For whatever reason if you cant get a web designer, don't use homegrow CSS design if you don't have web designer, use open source CSS/Javascript toolkit like [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap], or [Zurb Foundation][foundation]. It is free, cost nothing except learning curve for fundamental CSS/JQuery (developer must know basic CSS as well right?). Futhermore, a lot of open source components/tools around these frameworks like [JQuery file upload][fileupload] and [Bootsnipp][bootsnipp] can make your life easier. Still feel pain in the ass when design based on these frameworks? Buy a premium theme (from market [Wrapbootstrap][wrapbootstrap]), cost you few bucks but save your developers (or even designer) 1-2 weeks time (do your math!), sometime even more. It is not 2-3 pages of forms, it is a lot, sometime up to 50 pages.### SummaryTeam lead for enterprise application, stop hiding in cave. Go out and read latest technologies news, open sources tools, hacking on weekends.For enterprise company that doing enterprise application development, get a designer or use open source CSS/Javascript toolkits or buy a premium theme.[bootstrap]: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/[foundation]: http://foundation.zurb.com/[fileupload]: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/[bootsnipp]: http://bootsnipp.com/[wrapbootstrap]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/web/fulltext-search-at-jekyll-site/,  title   : Fulltext Search on Jekyll Site,  content : I power my blog using jekyll, a static blog generator. Recenty I saw a javascript full text search engine, [lunr][lunr] that really awesome. So I integrate into my blog and now my blog have full text search capibility! Awesome! So in this blog I will document and describe how I did it.### Download lunrBefore get started, you need download [lunr][lunr] at https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js and include in your blog js folder.### Index ContentBefore doing full text search, you need to index your blog content. First, create a `post.json` file in `_includes` folder as template to render post document:~~~{  id    : http://dreamand.me{{ post.url }},  title   : {{ post.title }},  content : {{ post.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | remove:''  }}}~~~After that, create a `search.js` at the root of the blog to hold the blog contents:~~~------var docs = [ {% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}  {% include post.json %},{% endfor %}];// init lunrvar idx = lunr(function () {  this.field('title', 10);  this.field('content');})// add each document to be indexfor(var index in docs) {  idx.add(docs[index]);}~~~**Note:** The file must begin with YAML front matter block so it will be processed by Jekyll as special files.Now your blog is index under `idx` object and you can search it. At the end of the documents, create a `lunr` with index fields **title** and **content** to be index.### SearchNow is time to create search capibility using html, javascript. First, include `search.js` and `lunr` js in your site:~~~~~~Is time to create `form` element for user to search, I have created partial `search.html` for display search form:~~~  Search                  GO!      ~~~Finally, add jquery to handle search event, add into `search.js` or other javascript file:~~~$(function() {  $(#search button).click(function() {    search();  });  $(#search input).keypress(function(e) {    if(e.which == 13) {      e.preventDefault();      search();    }  });})function search() {  var result = idx.search($(#search input).val());  if(result &amp;&amp; result.length &gt; 0) {    window.location.replace(result[0].ref);  } else {    alert(Found nothing);  }}~~~### ImprovementCurrently the search is not so user friendly where autocomplete is not available. When I am free I will improve it.### SummaryUsing [lunr][lunr], we able to bring the power of fulltext search to static generated blog, [jekyll][jekyll].
