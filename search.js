  "title"   : "What are the features that PaaS providers must have?",
  "content" : "Do you want ability to push application to cloud in minutes? Scale to multiple intances wihtout configure load balancer? Deploy without downtime? The future of web development will be like this with the PaaS.However, since this industry still new and recently just have few PaaS providers start to enter this space to compete, the features of the PaaS still incompete and some critical features need consider when design and develop new PaaS platform. In this post, I will list down all of the features that PaaS must have in future to really make the PaaS to be the developer’s choice.Top Features PaaS Must HaveMemory ManagementPaaS provider must have the ability to have custom memory allocation for all developers. This is especially important if you adversise your platform support multiple langauges but your platform only have one or two memory allocation options? No developers will run Java application on 512MB of memory and no one will run small NodeJS application on 512MB of memory as well. So custom memory allocation is very important for developers when they consider the patform.Pricing ModelThe main point of using PaaS is to remove the pain of manage system/os and hardware. One of the PaaS provide also the ability to scale up and down instantly. However, if the pricing model does not allow you to do that, then there is not point to market as scale instantly. For example, if the provider’s pricing model is based on subscription, then the memory limit for the plan will not allow the developers to scale up instantly if the memory allocation is reached the plan’s limit. He need to upgrade to larger plan before able to scale up again. If the spike only for last two or three days, the he will wasted his memory for the rest of the days of the month. Since he will not need that much memory/instance again. The future of PaaS should using pay as you go pricing model.Multiple Data CentersI believe must of the PaaS customers are from US. However, the future of PaaS will be multiple data center deployments. Developers should have options for them to deploy to. Mininum of three regions avaibility is required for future. The three regions I have in mind are US, Asia, and Europe. This also important for the provider as they can distribute the load/customers across regions to avoid one down all down situation. For example, Heroku have grow too large till their load balancing is not optimal anymore  due to large number of dynos. If Heroku have multiple deployment options, the load will distibute across regions since Asia customers will deploy to Asia data center and Europe customers will deploy to Europe data centers.DeploymentPaaS is suppose to ease the deployment of the applications. And one of the important ability is able to deploy without downtime. Or at least suring deployment downtime, show a custom page to visitors rather than showing provider’s error page or the domain is unreaachble.Top Players In PaaSHere I will show the comparison of current top PaaS providers, Heroku, CloudFoundry, and OpenShift.      Features    PaaS    Status        Memory Management    Heroku    512MB and 1G        CloudFoundry    Custom memory allocation        OpenShift    512MB and 1G        Pricing Model    Heroku    Pay as you go        CloudFoundry    Pay as you go        OpenShift    Pay as you go        Data Centers    Heroku    US and Europe        CloudFoundry    US        OpenShift    US        Deployment    Heroku    Have downtime and custom maintancen page        CloudFoundry    Have downtime        OpenShift    Have downtime (Only support for JBoss AS 7(hot deploy), PHP and Perl for no downtime)  ConclusionCurrently there is no PaaS provider that have all of the mentioned ability/features. Hope the PaaS space will be more competitive and grow to ease application management."

  "title"   : "Cloud Foundry V2 Hosted Developer Edition Review",
  "content" : "Cloud Foundry just moved to general available as paid service witn trial of 60 days of 2GB of RAM. During developer preview of Cloud Foundry, they operate under VMWare and now moved to Pivotal as paid service. Let see what CLoud Foundry provide to developers in this new raising PaaS industry.Cloud Foundry Pricing StructureCloud Foundry released their pricing structure, their pricing is based on RAM usage, which is appropiate in this PaaS industry. Cloud Foundry pricing is $0.03/GB/HR. It is pay as you go model, for example, let say you allocat 1 GB odf memory to application and you running two instances for 24 hours, then your billing will include $0.03 * 1GB * 24 HR = $0.72. If you run for one month, the price is around $21.6. The pricing is competitive with other PaaS provider such as Heroku and Openshift. Using Heroku with two dynos will cost $35 where first dyno is free(equalvalent to $0.097/GB/HR). While Openshift provide free service with 3 gears (512MB of memory each).Cloud Foundry New MarketplaceHeroku begin as PaaS giant and provive Marketplace, now this become a trend in PaaS industry, so the PaaS will have more features and the core product still can focus on building reliable platform for developers. Cloud Foundry is no exception, they provide a Marketplace as well with some other features/add-on that are not provided in core platform. Sice Cloud Foundry just moved to paid service, their Marketplace still not much options avaiable. As the time of writing, only 7 add-ons are available, but more and paid service will coming soon.Cloud Foundry Users and Space ManagementsCloud Foundry is open source project by VMWare and most of the VMWare customers are enterprise and large companies. Thus users management is very important aspect of the platform for enterprise and large companies. Cloud Foundry Hosted provide the same users management in the cloud with web console to access. This make Cloud Foundry very suitable for small freelances to large companies. Heroku on PaaS space is quite long enough and still do not have users and space management. Probably Heroku only target small companies?Cloud Foundry include space management as well for managing different environments. You can think space as environment such as production, Staging, and Development. This allow access control to avoid anyone in the organization to start, stop production applications. This is vefy good features for enterprise companies.ConclusionWhat I really like about Cloud Foundry is the ability to allocate appropriate memory to my application, most of the PaaS provides only allow fixed amout of memory, such as Heroku allow 512MB, 1GB and Openshift allow 512MB and 1GB. With the paid service of Cloud Foundry, their pricing is competitive as well. I hope Cloud Foundry keep moving forward and offer multiple regions deployment to stand up from other competitors, since multiple region deploymements will be killer features of PaaS space now."

  "title"   : "Java JEE7 JAX-RS 2.0 Client Example",
  "content" : "JEE6 JAX-RS 1.0 only include API for creating RESTful server application but no API for RESTFul client to consume the resources. Jersey, RESTEasy provide different API and make the client code vendor dependent. Now JEE7 JAX-RS 2.0 include Client API, which make the API vendor independent. In this blog, I will write the example of using JAX-RS 2.0.DependenciesI use maven to manage dependencies, the following pom.xml show the dependencies that I used:&lt;dependencies&gt;  &lt;dependency&gt;    &lt;groupId&gt;javax.ws.rs&lt;/groupId&gt;    &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.ws.rs-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;    &lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;    &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;  &lt;/dependency&gt;&lt;/dependencies&gt;The JAX-RS  2.0 implementation I use is Jersey bundled with Glassfish 4.0. However, since it is vendor independent, so whether you use JBoss, or Glassfish is the same.Create Client to Consume Github V3 APINow is tme to create Github client using JAX-RS 2.0. To create a instance of Client, use ClientBuilder.newClient() factory method to obtaint one.   Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();A Web resource can be accessed using a fluent API in which method invocations are chained to build and ultimately submit an HTTP request. The following example gets a application/json representation of theresource identified by https://api.github.com/users/octocat:  WebTarget userTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username});  userTarget      .resolveTemplate(username, octocat)      .request(application/json).get();Note that the {username} is the template to access RESTFul API with dynamic value, in this above example, the placeholder is replaced with octocat. This is usefull to access different resources on the server.The complete code to access user and repositories:public class GithubClient {        private Client client;    private WebTarget userTarget;    private WebTarget userRepoTarget;    public GithubClient() {        client = ClientBuilder.newClient();        userTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username});        userRepoTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos);    }        public String findUserByUsername(String username) {        Response res = userTarget                .resolveTemplate(username, username)                .request(application/json).get();        return res.readEntity(String.class);    }            public String findRepositoriesByUser(String username) {        Response res = userRepoTarget                .resolveTemplate(username, username)                .request(application/json).get();        return res.readEntity(String.class);    }}After created client to consume REST resource, now create a servlet to call the client:@WebServlet(value = /user)public class ClientExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {        @EJB    GithubClient client;    @Override    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {        resp.getWriter().print(client.findUserByUsername(req.getParameter(username)));    }}Then acces to browser http://localhost:8080/CONTEXT/client?username=octocat will show the following output:{   login:octocat,   id:583231,   avatar_url:https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ad39074b0584bc555d0417ae3e7d974?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png,   gravatar_id:7ad39074b0584bc555d0417ae3e7d974,   url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat,   html_url:https://github.com/octocat,   followers_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/followers,   following_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/following{/other_user},   gists_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/gists{/gist_id},   starred_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/starred{/owner}{/repo},   subscriptions_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/subscriptions,   organizations_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/orgs,   repos_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos,   events_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/events{/privacy},   received_events_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/received_events,   type:User,   name:The Octocat,   company:GitHub,   blog:http://www.github.com/blog,   location:San Francisco,   email:octocat@github.com,   hireable:false,   bio:null,   public_repos:3,   followers:360,   following:0,   created_at:2011-01-25T18:44:36Z,   updated_at:2013-06-02T04:35:58Z,   public_gists:4}ConclusionWith JAX-RS 2.0, now RESTFul client API is first class citizen. Vendor locking is no more and developers only need create one client using standard API."

  "content" : "JEE 7, the next release of Java Enterprice for large application will include a new enchanced JPA 2.1. JPA 2.1 now have native support for stored procedure. Folllow this blog post to know how to use soted procedure in JPA 2.1.Let get started how to use JPA 2.1 to execute stored procedure.DependenciesI use maven to manage dependencies, the following pom.xml show the dependencies that I used:&lt;dependencies&gt;    &lt;dependency&gt;        &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;        &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.persistence&lt;/artifactId&gt;        &lt;version&gt;2.1.0&lt;/version&gt;    &lt;/dependency&gt;    &lt;dependency&gt;        &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence&lt;/groupId&gt;        &lt;artifactId&gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa&lt;/artifactId&gt;        &lt;version&gt;2.5.0&lt;/version&gt;    &lt;/dependency&gt;    &lt;!-- jdbc driver for Postgresql --&gt;    &lt;dependency&gt;        &lt;groupId&gt;postgresql&lt;/groupId&gt;        &lt;artifactId&gt;postgresql&lt;/artifactId&gt;        &lt;version&gt;9.1-901.jdbc4&lt;/version&gt;        &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;    &lt;/dependency&gt;&lt;/dependencies&gt;The JPA 2.1 implementation that I use is Eclipselink, which is Reference Implementation for JPA 2.1.Note the database that I use is Postgresql, you can use appropiate JDBC driver for your database. Setup persistence.xml for JPA 2.1The persistence.xml for JPA 2.1 is similar with that of JPA 2.0, but with the different version of xsd. The following shows the persistence.xml that I used for JPA 2.1:&lt;?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?&gt;&lt;persistence version=2.1 xmlns=http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence              xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance              xsi:schemaLocation=http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence                                                  http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd&gt;  &lt;persistence-unit name=transactions-optional&gt;    &lt;provider&gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider&lt;/provider&gt;    &lt;properties&gt;      &lt;property name=javax.persistence.jdbc.driver value=org.postgresql.Driver/&gt;      &lt;property name=javax.persistence.jdbc.url value=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dreamandme/&gt;      &lt;property name=javax.persistence.jdbc.user value=postgres/&gt;      &lt;property name=javax.persistence.jdbc.password value=password/&gt;      &lt;property name=eclipselink.ddl-generation value=create-tables/&gt;    &lt;/properties&gt;  &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;&lt;/persistence&gt;Create Stored Procedure For PostgresqlIn this example, I use Postgresql as database. The follows is the stored procedured that I created for this tutorial:CREATE FUNCTION sales_tax(subtotal float, OUT tax float) AS $$BEGIN    tax := subtotal * 0.06;END;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;This stored procedure simple take subtotal as IN then tax as OUT.Java JPA 2.1 Stored Procedure CallThe next step is going to the main purpose of the example, call stored procedure in Java JEE7 JPA 2.1, the following is the example code:package me.dreamand.jee7.jpa21;import javax.persistence.EntityManager;import javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory;import javax.persistence.ParameterMode;import javax.persistence.Persistence;import javax.persistence.StoredProcedureQuery;public class App {    private static final String PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME = transactions-optional;    private static EntityManagerFactory factory;    public static void main(String[] args) {        factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME);        EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager();        // Create call stored procedure        em.getTransaction().begin();        StoredProcedureQuery storedProcedure = em.createStoredProcedureQuery(sales_tax);        // set parameters        storedProcedure.registerStoredProcedureParameter(subtotal, Double.class, ParameterMode.IN);        storedProcedure.registerStoredProcedureParameter(tax, Double.class, ParameterMode.OUT);        storedProcedure.setParameter(subtotal, 1f);        // execute SP        storedProcedure.execute();        // get result        Double tax = (Double)storedProcedure.getOutputParameterValue(tax);        System.out.println(Tax is:  + tax);        em.getTransaction().commit();        em.close();    }}Run the main method, the console will output the following text:Tax is: 0.06ConclusionWith the new Java JEE7 JPA 2.1 release bring stored procedure support to the next level without using JDBC low level API. This bring JEE7 to the next most awaited release of JEE."

  "title"   : "JEE7 WebSocket Example",
  "content" : "JEE 7, the next release of Java Enterprice for large application will include a standard WebSocket API for create realtime communication channel over a single TCP connection. The realtime communication allow server to push message to clients in realtime. This tutorial will teach step by step to create a realtime chat program using JEE7 WebSocket API. There are two ways to using  JEE7’s WebSocket API, one is using annotations and another is using normal OO concept to extend classes. This tutorial will mainly focus on using annotations based API.Maven DependenciesRecommended way to manage Java Application’s dependencies is using maven. This tutorial will using maven to manage dependencies. Include the following snippet into your pom file dependencies section:&lt;dependencies&gt;    &lt;dependency&gt;        &lt;groupId&gt;javax&lt;/groupId&gt;        &lt;artifactId&gt;javaee-web-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;        &lt;version&gt;7.0-b83&lt;/version&gt;        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;    &lt;/dependency&gt;    &lt;dependency&gt;        &lt;groupId&gt;javax.websocket&lt;/groupId&gt;        &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.websocket-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;        &lt;version&gt;1.0-rc5&lt;/version&gt;        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;    &lt;/dependency&gt;&lt;/dependencies&gt;Note that the latest version of WebSocket API is rc5, to get the latest version, please browse to maven repo websocket to check out.Annotation UsageBefore get start to use JEE7 WebSocket, let introduce the usage of the annotations:            Annotation      Description                  @ServerEndpoint      Annotate class as server end point              @OnOpen      Involked when new connection is established              @OnMessage      Involked when new message is received              @OnClose      Involked when existing connection is closd              @OnError      Involked when there is error in communication channel      Chat ProgramBased on the annotation usage, we can create a simple chat program using the following code:package me.dreamand.blog.websocket;import java.util.logging.Level;import java.util.logging.Logger;import javax.websocket.OnClose;import javax.websocket.OnError;import javax.websocket.OnMessage;import javax.websocket.OnOpen;import javax.websocket.Session;import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;@ServerEndpoint(value = /chat)public class ChatServer {        private static final Logger LOGGER =             Logger.getLogger(ChatServer.class.getName());        @OnOpen    public void onOpen(Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, New connection with client: {0},                 session.getId());    }        @OnMessage    public String onMessage(String message, Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, New message from Client [{0}]: {1},                 new Object[] {session.getId(), message});        return Server received [ + message + ];    }        @OnClose    public void onClose(Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, Close connection for client: {0},                 session.getId());    }        @OnError    public void onError(Throwable exception, Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, Error for client: {0}, session.getId());    }}HTML and Javascript For WebSocketThe next step is to create a client for the chat program. The browser must support WebSocket. The following shows the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the browser:&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;        &lt;title&gt;JEE7 WebSocket Example&lt;/title&gt;        &lt;meta http-equiv=Content-Type content=text/html; charset=UTF-8&gt;        &lt;link rel=shortcut icon href=/websocket/favicon.ico&gt;        &lt;style&gt;            #container {                border: 1px #999999 solid;                padding: 10px;            }            p.client {                border-bottom: 1px aquamarine solid;            }            p.server {                border-bottom: 1px crimson solid;            }            input {                padding: 5px;                width: 250px;            }            button {                padding: 5px;            }        &lt;/style&gt;        &lt;script&gt;            var chatClient = new WebSocket(ws://localhost:8080/websocket/chat);                        chatClient.onmessage = function(evt) {                var p = document.createElement(p);                p.setAttribute(class, server);                p.innerHTML = Server:  + evt.data;                var container = document.getElementById(container);                container.appendChild(p);            }            function send() {                var input = document.getElementById(message);                var p = document.createElement(p);                p.setAttribute(class, client);                p.innerHTML = Me:  + input.value;                var container = document.getElementById(container);                container.appendChild(p);                chatClient.send(input.value);                input.value = ;            }        &lt;/script&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;JEE7 WebSocket Example&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;div id=container&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;input type=text id=message name=message /&gt;        &lt;button type=button id=send onclick=send()&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;Running JEE7 WebSocket ApplictionTo run JEE7 WebSocket enabled application, this tutorial is deploy to GlassFish 4.The following screenshot show the UI and server log for the program:ConclusionJEE7 is joining the new HTML5 wave for WebSocket for duplex comunication channel.

  "content" : "Want better SEO for your e-commerce and dynamic website? Want to increase organic search for your e-commerce and dynamic website? This post will shows how to build better URL for your website and increase sell and better page impression.Use CaseLet say your website is selling cars, and to have better SEO for your site, you can follow this post to design the URL that boost organic search to a better score. Identify URL HierarchyTo design a truely SEO friendly URL for this use case, let see what is the hierarchy for cars. To easily identify the hierarchy, you can follow your database design, for example, one make have one to many models, and one models have zero to many post on your website.Then you can know that the URL structur is like:http://exmple.com/make/model/postThus the actual URL might look like:http://exmple.com/honda/civic/1-honda-civic-for-sellTips:If the hierarchy is too deep, you can use shorter URL for each individual post, for example:http://exmple.com/show/1-honda-civic-for-sellBut remember, include a breadcrumb in the page to let user to navigate up to the hierarchy, for example:Home &gt; Honda &gt; Civic &gt; Honda Civic For SellBy thi way, the visitor will happy and Google Search will intelgent enough to identify your website structure.SEO Friendly URLAfter identified the URL structure, the next step is to purpose a friendly URL. The followings shows the guideline for friendly URL:  All lowercase (Yes, some website still mixing uppercase and lowercase)  No whitespace, and whitespace is replaced by hyphen (“-“)  Not too long (Less than 85 characters)  Contain one to three keywords, not too much  ASCII only charactersUsing the guideline, a friendly URL example is show at below:http://exmple.com/mercedes-benz/c-class/1-mercedes-benz-c-class-for-sellorhttp://exmple.com/honda/civic/1-honda-civic-for-sellBetter Search Landing PageSo your website contain a search box for visitors to search for what they really want, instead of landing to a page with URL http://exmple.com/search?q=honda, you can redirect to a dedicated page for all honda’s cars with better SEO URL as follow:http://exmple.com/hondaorhttp://exmple.com/honda/civicfor paginationhttp://exmple.com/honda/civic?page=2By using this tip, you provide a better SEO friendly URL for Search Engine to index and user friendly too.Ask Google Index Your URLsThe ultimate step is to index all of your URLs using sitemap.xml by generating all of the possible URLs for your website. But do not generate individual URL for each post in sitemap.xml, instead, Google will index the individual post via the search landing page.Example of sitemap.xml:&lt;?xml version=1.0 encoding=UTF-8?&gt;&lt;urlset    xmlns=http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9    xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance    xsi:schemaLocation=http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9            http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd&gt;  &lt;url&gt;    &lt;loc&gt;http://example.com&lt;/loc&gt;    &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;    &lt;priority&gt;0.8&lt;/priority&gt;  &lt;/url&gt;  &lt;url&gt;    &lt;loc&gt;http://example.com/audi&lt;/loc&gt;    &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;  &lt;/url&gt;  &lt;url&gt;    &lt;loc&gt;http://example.com/hyundai&lt;/loc&gt;    &lt;changefreq&gt;daily&lt;/changefreq&gt;  &lt;/url&gt;&lt;/urlset&gt;Sitemaps are particularly helpful if:  Your site has dynamic content.  Your site has pages that aren’t easily discoverd by Googlebot during the crawl process-for example, pages featuring rich AJAX or images.  Your site is new and has few links to it. (Googlebot crawls the web by following links from one page to another, so if your site isn’t well linked, it may be hard to Google to discover it.)ConclusionFollowing this post’s tips and guideline, you can increase your website’s organic search impression and more visitors will visit your site."

  "content" : "With recent Amazon Web Service (AWS) announcement that new service to their cloud, some of the might companies will be out of business. For example AWS just announced a NodeJS support for their Elastic Beanstalk. In future AWS definitely will adding more service to compete with current providers out there. Which at this point is compete with PaaS providers out there.If you just think about a business that add value to AWS, you can stop it now. Because you don’t know when AWS will have plan that add that service to their huge platform and bring you down. So is time stop for bootstrap/startup a company that provide additional service to AWS and think something else.AWS is More Than Just IaaS (Soon)The giant busisness that host thousand  of online services such as Reddit, NetFlix still innovating with their platform by adding more services and lowing price. At some point of future, I think they will add some services on top of current platform after they finish innovate on infrastructure. For examle, now they start to adding more services on top of EC2 such as Elastic Beanstalk which is management service (kind of what Platform as a Service doing out there) that supporting Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. I think soon new language will be added (Which language you want? Maybe can requst to AWS). With recent announcement, AWS added AMI Copy for Amazon EC2 that enables you to easily copy your AMIs across AWS regions. If one of your business value is able copy AMI across regions seamlessly, now this feature is not special anymore. Not only Amazon is giant company, their low price is a killing factor that will bring your business down. Unless what you doing is a critical service that have customers willing to pay more.But Not So SoonHowever, AWS will not adding so much services that no other business can add service to their platform. PaaS business might have some worry since Elastic Beanstalk look like is compete with them. For now Elastic Beanstalk still not much features, however, you cant guarantee in next 2-3 years they wouldn’t catch up. As you can see Heroku’s innovation in this few years, nothing much changes except they added Database as a Service using Postgresql which is awesome product. But at some point AWS might add Postgresql to their Database as a Service as well right? We can’t eliminate this possibility since MySQL (as RDS) is available on AWS.Keep InnovatingOf course not only AWS compete with some provider out there, competition is everywhere. Burger King compete with McDonald, your company with other company. In IT world, you can keep innovating your product to gain/retain customers."

Ten years ago, copy and paste actually is programmer’s task. No one like pages of messy codes, sometime the code having not usage at all.

Scale to multiple intances wihtout configure load balancer? Deploy without downtime? The future of web development will be like this with the PaaS.However, since this industry still new and recently just have few PaaS providers start to enter this space to compete, the features of the PaaS still incompete and some critical features need consider when design and develop new PaaS platform. In this post, I will list down all of the features that PaaS must have in future to really make the PaaS to be the developer's choice.### Top Features PaaS Must Have#### Memory ManagementPaaS provider must have the ability to have custom memory allocation for all developers. This is especially important if you adversise your platform support multiple langauges but your platform only have one or two memory allocation options? No developers will run Java application on 512MB of memory and no one will run small NodeJS application on 512MB of memory as well. So custom memory allocation is very important for developers when they consider the patform.#### Pricing ModelThe main point of using PaaS is to remove the pain of manage system/os and hardware. One of the PaaS provide also the ability to scale up and down instantly. However, if the pricing model does not allow you to do that, then there is not point to market as scale instantly. For example, if the provider's pricing model is based on subscription, then the memory limit for the plan will not allow the developers to scale up instantly if the memory allocation is reached the plan's limit. He need to upgrade to larger plan before able to scale up again. If the spike only for last two or three days, the he will wasted his memory for the rest of the days of the month. Since he will not need that much memory/instance again. The future of PaaS should using pay as you go pricing model.#### Multiple Data CentersI believe must of the PaaS customers are from US. However, the future of PaaS will be multiple data center deployments. Developers should have options for them to deploy to. Mininum of three regions avaibility is required for future. The three regions I have in mind are US, Asia, and Europe. This also important for the provider as they can distribute the load/customers across regions to **avoid one down all down** situation. For example, **Heroku** have grow too large till their load balancing is [not optimal anymore][heroku]  due to large number of dynos. If Heroku have multiple deployment options, the load will distibute across regions since Asia customers will deploy to Asia data center and Europe customers will deploy to Europe data centers.#### DeploymentPaaS is suppose to ease the deployment of the applications. And one of the important ability is able to deploy without downtime. Or at least suring deployment downtime, show a custom page to visitors rather than showing provider's error page or the domain is unreaachble.### Top Players In PaaSHere I will show the comparison of current top PaaS providers, Heroku, CloudFoundry, and OpenShift.      Features    PaaS    Status        Memory Management    Heroku    512MB and 1G        CloudFoundry    Custom memory allocation        OpenShift    512MB and 1G        Pricing Model    Heroku    Pay as you go        CloudFoundry    Pay as you go        OpenShift    Pay as you go        Data Centers    Heroku    US and Europe        CloudFoundry    US        OpenShift    US        Deployment    Heroku    Have downtime and custom maintancen page        CloudFoundry    Have downtime        OpenShift    Have downtime (Only support for JBoss AS 7(hot deploy), PHP and Perl for no downtime)  ### ConclusionCurrently there is no PaaS provider that have all of the mentioned ability/features. Hope the PaaS space will be more competitive and grow to ease application management.[heroku]: http://news.rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-lyrics},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/cloud/cloudfoundry-v2-review/,  title   : Cloud Foundry V2 Hosted Developer Edition Review,  content : Cloud Foundry just moved to general available as paid service witn trial of 60 days of 2GB of RAM. During developer preview of Cloud Foundry, they operate under VMWare and now moved to Pivotal as paid service. Let see what CLoud Foundry provide to developers in this new raising PaaS industry.### Cloud Foundry Pricing StructureCloud Foundry released their pricing structure, their pricing is based on RAM usage, which is appropiate in this PaaS industry. Cloud Foundry pricing is $0.03/GB/HR. It is pay as you go model, for example, let say you allocat 1 GB odf memory to application and you running two instances for 24 hours, then your billing will include $0.03 * 1GB * 24 HR = $0.72. If you run for one month, the price is around $21.6. The pricing is competitive with other PaaS provider such as Heroku and Openshift. Using Heroku with two dynos will cost $35 where first dyno is free(equalvalent to $0.097/GB/HR). While Openshift provide free service with 3 gears (512MB of memory each).![Cloud Foundry Pricing](/img/posts/cloud/cloudfoundry-pricing.png Cloud Foundry Pricing)### Cloud Foundry New MarketplaceHeroku begin as PaaS giant and provive Marketplace, now this become a trend in PaaS industry, so the PaaS will have more features and the core product still can focus on building reliable platform for developers. Cloud Foundry is no exception, they provide a Marketplace as well with some other features/add-on that are not provided in core platform. Sice Cloud Foundry just moved to paid service, their Marketplace still not much options avaiable. As the time of writing, only 7 add-ons are available, but more and paid service will coming soon.![Cloud Foundry Marketplace](/img/posts/cloud/cloudfoundry-marketplace.png Cloud Foundry Marketplace)### Cloud Foundry Users and Space ManagementsCloud Foundry is open source project by VMWare and most of the VMWare customers are enterprise and large companies. Thus users management is very important aspect of the platform for enterprise and large companies. Cloud Foundry Hosted provide the same users management in the cloud with web console to access. This make Cloud Foundry very suitable for small freelances to large companies. Heroku on PaaS space is quite long enough and still do not have users and space management. Probably Heroku only target small companies?Cloud Foundry include space management as well for managing different environments. You can think space as environment such as *production*, *Staging*, and *Development*. This allow access control to avoid anyone in the organization to start, stop production applications. This is vefy good features for enterprise companies.![Cloud Foundry Users and Space Management](/img/posts/cloud/cloudfoundry-usersmanagement.png Cloud Foundry Users and Space Management)### ConclusionWhat I really like about Cloud Foundry is the ability to allocate appropriate memory to my application, most of the PaaS provides only allow fixed amout of memory, such as Heroku allow 512MB, 1GB and Openshift allow 512MB and 1GB. With the paid service of Cloud Foundry, their pricing is competitive as well. I hope Cloud Foundry keep moving forward and offer multiple regions deployment to stand up from other competitors, since multiple region deploymements will be killer features of PaaS space now.},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/java/jee7-websocket-decode-custom-message/,  title   : Java JEE7 JAX-RS 2.0 Client Example,  content : JEE6 JAX-RS 1.0 only include API for creating RESTful server application but no API for RESTFul client to consume the resources. [Jersey][Jersey], [RESTEasy][RESTEasy] provide different API and make the client code vendor dependent. Now JEE7 [JAX-RS 2.0][jax-rs] include Client API, which make the API vendor independent. In this blog, I will write the example of using [JAX-RS 2.0][jax-rs].### DependenciesI use maven to manage dependencies, the following `pom.xml` show the dependencies that I used:~~~      javax.ws.rs    javax.ws.rs-api    2.0    provided  ~~~The JAX-RS  2.0 implementation I use is Jersey bundled with [Glassfish 4.0][glassfish]. However, since it is vendor independent, so whether you use JBoss, or Glassfish is the same.### Create Client to Consume Github V3 APINow is tme to create Github client using JAX-RS 2.0. To create a instance of `Client`, use `ClientBuilder.newClient()` factory method to obtaint one. ~~~  Client client = ClientBuilder.newClient();~~~A Web resource can be accessed using a fluent API in which method invocations are chained to build and ultimately submit an HTTP request. The following example gets a `application/json` representation of theresource identified by `https://api.github.com/users/octocat`:~~~  WebTarget userTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username});  userTarget      .resolveTemplate(username, octocat)      .request(application/json).get();~~~Note that the `{username}` is the template to access RESTFul API with dynamic value, in this above example, the placeholder is replaced with `octocat`. This is usefull to access different resources on the server.The complete code to access `user` and `repositories`:~~~public class GithubClient {        private Client client;    private WebTarget userTarget;    private WebTarget userRepoTarget;    public GithubClient() {        client = ClientBuilder.newClient();        userTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username});        userRepoTarget = client.target(https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos);    }        public String findUserByUsername(String username) {        Response res = userTarget                .resolveTemplate(username, username)                .request(application/json).get();        return res.readEntity(String.class);    }            public String findRepositoriesByUser(String username) {        Response res = userRepoTarget                .resolveTemplate(username, username)                .request(application/json).get();        return res.readEntity(String.class);    }}~~~After created client to consume REST resource, now create a servlet to call the client:~~~@WebServlet(value = /user)public class ClientExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {        @EJB    GithubClient client;    @Override    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {        resp.getWriter().print(client.findUserByUsername(req.getParameter(username)));    }}~~~Then acces to browser [http://localhost:8080/CONTEXT/client?username=octocat][localhost] will show the following output:~~~{   login:octocat,   id:583231,   avatar_url:https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ad39074b0584bc555d0417ae3e7d974?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png,   gravatar_id:7ad39074b0584bc555d0417ae3e7d974,   url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat,   html_url:https://github.com/octocat,   followers_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/followers,   following_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/following{/other_user},   gists_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/gists{/gist_id},   starred_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/starred{/owner}{/repo},   subscriptions_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/subscriptions,   organizations_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/orgs,   repos_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/repos,   events_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/events{/privacy},   received_events_url:https://api.github.com/users/octocat/received_events,   type:User,   name:The Octocat,   company:GitHub,   blog:http://www.github.com/blog,   location:San Francisco,   email:octocat@github.com,   hireable:false,   bio:null,   public_repos:3,   followers:360,   following:0,   created_at:2011-01-25T18:44:36Z,   updated_at:2013-06-02T04:35:58Z,   public_gists:4}~~~### ConclusionWith JAX-RS 2.0, now RESTFul client API is first class citizen. Vendor locking is no more and developers only need create one client using standard API.[glassfish]: http://glassfish.java.net[RESTEasy]: http://www.jboss.org/resteasy[Jersey]: http://jersey.java.net[jax-rs]: http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339[localhost]: http://localhost:8080/CONTEXT/client?username=octocat},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/java/java-jee7-jpa-stored-procedure-example/,  title   : Java JEE7 JPA 2.1 Stored Procedure Example,  content : JEE 7, the next release of Java Enterprice for large application will include a new enchanced JPA 2.1. JPA 2.1 now have native support for stored procedure. Folllow this blog post to know how to use soted procedure in JPA 2.1.Let get started how to use JPA 2.1 to execute stored procedure.### DependenciesI use maven to manage dependencies, the following `pom.xml` show the dependencies that I used:~~~            org.eclipse.persistence        javax.persistence        2.1.0                org.eclipse.persistence        org.eclipse.persistence.jpa        2.5.0                    postgresql        postgresql        9.1-901.jdbc4        runtime    ~~~The JPA 2.1 implementation that I use is Eclipselink, which is Reference Implementation for JPA 2.1.Note the database that I use is Postgresql, you can use appropiate JDBC driver for your database. ### Setup persistence.xml for JPA 2.1The `persistence.xml` for JPA 2.1 is similar with that of JPA 2.0, but with the different version of `xsd`. The following shows the persistence.xml that I used for JPA 2.1:~~~&lt;persistence version=2.1 xmlns=http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence              xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance              xsi:schemaLocation=http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence                                                  http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd&gt;      org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider                                        ~~~### Create Stored Procedure For PostgresqlIn this example, I use Postgresql as database. The follows is the stored procedured that I created for this tutorial:~~~CREATE FUNCTION sales_tax(subtotal float, OUT tax float) AS $$BEGIN    tax := subtotal * 0.06;END;$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;~~~This stored procedure simple take `subtotal` as `IN` then `tax` as `OUT`.### Java JPA 2.1 Stored Procedure CallThe next step is going to the main purpose of the example, call stored procedure in Java JEE7 JPA 2.1, the following is the example code:~~~package me.dreamand.jee7.jpa21;import javax.persistence.EntityManager;import javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory;import javax.persistence.ParameterMode;import javax.persistence.Persistence;import javax.persistence.StoredProcedureQuery;public class App {    private static final String PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME = transactions-optional;    private static EntityManagerFactory factory;    public static void main(String[] args) {        factory = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(PERSISTENCE_UNIT_NAME);        EntityManager em = factory.createEntityManager();        // Create call stored procedure        em.getTransaction().begin();        StoredProcedureQuery storedProcedure = em.createStoredProcedureQuery(sales_tax);        // set parameters        storedProcedure.registerStoredProcedureParameter(subtotal, Double.class, ParameterMode.IN);        storedProcedure.registerStoredProcedureParameter(tax, Double.class, ParameterMode.OUT);        storedProcedure.setParameter(subtotal, 1f);        // execute SP        storedProcedure.execute();        // get result        Double tax = (Double)storedProcedure.getOutputParameterValue(tax);        System.out.println(Tax is:  + tax);        em.getTransaction().commit();        em.close();    }}~~~Run the `main` method, the console will output the following text:~~~Tax is: 0.06~~~### ConclusionWith the new Java JEE7 JPA 2.1 release bring stored procedure support to the next level without using JDBC low level API. This bring JEE7 to the next most awaited release of JEE.},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/java/jee7-websocket-example/,  title   : JEE7 WebSocket Example,  content : JEE 7, the next release of Java Enterprice for large application will include a standard WebSocket API for create realtime communication channel over a single TCP connection. The realtime communication allow server to push message to clients in realtime. This tutorial will teach step by step to create a realtime chat program using JEE7 WebSocket API. There are two ways to using  JEE7's WebSocket API, one is using annotations and another is using normal OO concept to extend classes. This tutorial will mainly focus on using annotations based API.### Maven DependenciesRecommended way to manage Java Application's dependencies is using maven. This tutorial will using maven to manage dependencies. Include the following snippet into your pom file `dependencies` section:~~~            javax        javaee-web-api        7.0-b83        provided                javax.websocket        javax.websocket-api        1.0-rc5        provided    ~~~Note that the latest version of WebSocket API is rc5, to get the latest version, please browse to [maven repo websocket][maven repo websocket] to check out.### Annotation UsageBefore get start to use JEE7 WebSocket, let introduce the usage of the annotations:| Annotation       | Description                                           || ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- || @ServerEndpoint  | Annotate class as server end point                    || @OnOpen          | Involked when new connection is established           || @OnMessage       | Involked when new message is received                 || @OnClose         | Involked when existing connection is closd            || @OnError         | Involked when there is error in communication channel |### Chat ProgramBased on the annotation usage, we can create a simple chat program using the following code:~~~package me.dreamand.blog.websocket;import java.util.logging.Level;import java.util.logging.Logger;import javax.websocket.OnClose;import javax.websocket.OnError;import javax.websocket.OnMessage;import javax.websocket.OnOpen;import javax.websocket.Session;import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;@ServerEndpoint(value = /chat)public class ChatServer {        private static final Logger LOGGER =             Logger.getLogger(ChatServer.class.getName());        @OnOpen    public void onOpen(Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, New connection with client: {0},                 session.getId());    }        @OnMessage    public String onMessage(String message, Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, New message from Client [{0}]: {1},                 new Object[] {session.getId(), message});        return Server received [ + message + ];    }        @OnClose    public void onClose(Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, Close connection for client: {0},                 session.getId());    }        @OnError    public void onError(Throwable exception, Session session) {        LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, Error for client: {0}, session.getId());    }}~~~### HTML and Javascript For WebSocketThe next step is to create a client for the chat program. The browser must support WebSocket. The following shows the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the browser:~~~            JEE7 WebSocket Example                                    #container {                border: 1px #999999 solid;                padding: 10px;            }            p.client {                border-bottom: 1px aquamarine solid;            }            p.server {                border-bottom: 1px crimson solid;            }            input {                padding: 5px;                width: 250px;            }            button {                padding: 5px;            }                            var chatClient = new WebSocket(ws://localhost:8080/websocket/chat);                        chatClient.onmessage = function(evt) {                var p = document.createElement(p);                p.setAttribute(class, server);                p.innerHTML = Server:  + evt.data;                var container = document.getElementById(container);                container.appendChild(p);            }            function send() {                var input = document.getElementById(message);                var p = document.createElement(p);                p.setAttribute(class, client);                p.innerHTML = Me:  + input.value;                var container = document.getElementById(container);                container.appendChild(p);                chatClient.send(input.value);                input.value = ;            }                        JEE7 WebSocket Example                                            Send    ~~~### Running JEE7 WebSocket ApplictionTo run JEE7 WebSocket enabled application, this tutorial is deploy to GlassFish 4.The following screenshot show the UI and server log for the program:![Initial send message](/img/posts/jee7/chat-1.png Initial send message)![Server reply message](/img/posts/jee7/chat-2.png Server reply message)![Sent second message](/img/posts/jee7/chat-3.png Sent second message)![Server log show activities](/img/posts/jee7/server-log.png Server log show activities)### ConclusionJEE7 is joining the new HTML5 wave for WebSocket for duplex comunication channel. Realtime commication is one of the essential aspect for enterprise application, now with native support without AJAX pooling. In the near future will have large scale applications deploy to use this feature.[websocket]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[maven repo websocket]: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/javax/websocket/javax.websocket-api/},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/web/better-url-for-seo/,  title   : Better URL for SEO for E-Commerce and Dynamic Website,  content : Want better SEO for your e-commerce and dynamic website? Want to increase organic search for your e-commerce and dynamic website? This post will shows how to build better URL for your website and increase sell and better page impression.### Use CaseLet say your website is selling cars, and to have better SEO for your site, you can follow this post to design the URL that boost organic search to a better score. ### Identify URL HierarchyTo design a truely SEO friendly URL for this use case, let see what is the hierarchy for cars. To easily identify the hierarchy, you can follow your database design, for example, one make have one to many models, and one models have zero to many post on your website.Then you can know that the URL structur is like:~~~http://exmple.com/make/model/post~~~Thus the actual URL might look like:~~~http://exmple.com/honda/civic/1-honda-civic-for-sell~~~Tips:If the hierarchy is too deep, you can use shorter URL for each individual post, for example:~~~http://exmple.com/show/1-honda-civic-for-sell~~~But remember, include a breadcrumb in the page to let user to navigate up to the hierarchy, for example:~~~Home &gt; Honda &gt; Civic &gt; Honda Civic For Sell~~~By thi way, the visitor will happy and Google Search will intelgent enough to identify your website structure.### SEO Friendly URLAfter identified the URL structure, the next step is to purpose a friendly URL. The followings shows the guideline for friendly URL:1. All lowercase (Yes, some website still mixing uppercase and lowercase)2. No whitespace, and whitespace is replaced by hyphen (-)3. Not too long (Less than 85 characters)4. Contain one to three keywords, not too much5. ASCII only charactersUsing the guideline, a friendly URL example is show at below:~~~http://exmple.com/mercedes-benz/c-class/1-mercedes-benz-c-class-for-sellorhttp://exmple.com/honda/civic/1-honda-civic-for-sell~~~### Better Search Landing PageSo your website contain a search box for visitors to search for what they really want, instead of landing to a page with URL `http://exmple.com/search?q=honda`, you can redirect to a dedicated page for all honda's cars with better SEO URL as follow:~~~http://exmple.com/hondaorhttp://exmple.com/honda/civicfor paginationhttp://exmple.com/honda/civic?page=2~~~By using this tip, you provide a better SEO friendly URL for Search Engine to index and user friendly too.### Ask Google Index Your URLsThe ultimate step is to index all of your URLs using `sitemap.xml` by generating all of the possible URLs for your website. But do not generate individual URL for each post in `sitemap.xml`, instead, Google will index the individual post via the search landing page.Example of `sitemap.xml`:~~~&lt;urlset    xmlns=http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9    xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance    xsi:schemaLocation=http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9            http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9/sitemap.xsd&gt;      http://example.com    daily    0.8        http://example.com/audi    daily        http://example.com/hyundai    daily  ~~~{: .language-xml}Sitemaps are particularly helpful if:1. Your site has dynamic content.2. Your site has pages that aren't easily discoverd by Googlebot during the crawl process-for example, pages featuring rich AJAX or images.3. Your site is new and has few links to it. (Googlebot crawls the web by following links from one page to another, so if your site isn't well linked, it may be hard to Google to discover it.)### ConclusionFollowing this post's tips and guideline, you can increase your website's organic search impression and more visitors will visit your site.},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/java/jee7-json-example/,  title   : JEE7 JSON API Example,  content : JEE 7, the next release of Java Enterprice Edition for large application will include a standard JSON API without using third party JSON API such as [JSON.org][jsobn-org]. Is time to use standard API for Java web development.### SetupI use [maven][maven] for managing dependencies and the RI for JSON API is from [glassfish][glassfish]. You can download the jars into your project as well from [json-api][json-api] and [json-ri][json-ri] from maven site if you not using maven to manage dependency.

For example AWS just announced a [NodeJS support][nodejs-aws] for their [Elastic Beanstalk][beanstalk]. In future AWS definitely will adding more service to compete with current providers out there. Which at this point is compete with PaaS providers out there.If you just think about a business that add value to AWS, you can stop it now. Because you don't know when AWS will have plan that add that service to their huge platform and bring you down. So is time stop for bootstrap/startup a company that provide additional service to AWS and think something else.### AWS is More Than Just IaaS (Soon)The giant busisness that host thousand  of online services such as [Reddit][reddit], [NetFlix][netflix] still innovating with their platform by adding more services and lowing price. At some point of future, I think they will add some services on top of current platform after they **finish** innovate on infrastructure. For examle, now they start to adding more services on top of EC2 such as [Elastic Beanstalk][beanstalk] which is management service (kind of what Platform as a Service doing out there) that supporting Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. I think soon new language will be added (Which language you want? Maybe can requst to AWS). With recent announcement, AWS added [AMI Copy for Amazon EC2][copy] that enables you to easily copy your AMIs across AWS regions. If one of your business value is able **copy AMI across regions seamlessly**, now this feature is not **special** anymore. Not only Amazon is giant company, their low price is a killing factor that will bring your business down. Unless what you doing is a critical service that have customers willing to pay more.### But Not So SoonHowever, AWS will not adding so much services that no other business can add service to their platform. PaaS business might have some worry since [Elastic Beanstalk][beanstalk] look like is compete with them. For now [Elastic Beanstalk][beanstalk] still not much features, however, you cant guarantee in next 2-3 years they wouldn't catch up. As you can see [Heroku][heroku]'s innovation in this few years, nothing much changes except they added Database as a Service using [Postgresql][postgresql] which is awesome product. But at some point AWS might add [Postgresql][postgresql] to their Database as a Service as well right? We can't eliminate this possibility since MySQL (as RDS) is available on AWS.### Keep InnovatingOf course not only AWS compete with some provider out there, competition is everywhere. Burger King compete with McDonald, your company with other company. In IT world, you can keep innovating your product to gain/retain customers.[aws]: http://aws.amazon.com[nodejs-aws]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html[beanstalk]: http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk[copy]: http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2013/03/12/announcing-ami-copy-for-amazon-ec2/[reddit]: http://reddit.com[netflix]: www.netflix.com[heroku]: http://www.heroku.com[postgresql]: http://www.postgresql.org/},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/web/get-a-web-designer-for-enterprise-application/,  title   : You Should Get Web Designer for Your Enterprise Application,  content : A lot of enteprise web applicaions still using `iframe` and the html code is a mess. When doing maintenance, developers feel pain in the ass when modify the style and html. It is time to get a web designer for enterprise application, right now!### Lost in HTML, CSS, and Javascript![Messy HTML](/img/posts/messy-html.jpg Messy HTML)Especially for old system, the developer is designer, they violent  **DRY** principal. Ten years ago, copy and paste actually is programmer's task. No one like pages of messy codes, sometime the code having not usage at all. But now is 21th century, is time to change, hire a web designer for enterprise application, not only for better ui design, but also for cleaner code.Enterprise web application is well known in having a lot of complex forms, a lot of fields in single page. It time to let UX expert to improve those forms. They will have better idea/trick to design that. Of course, sometime add a designer into development is not easy especially people think I dont want to break thing. But in long term, you will see the benefits.### Last Choice![Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation](/img/posts/bootstrap-fundation.png Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation)For whatever reason if you cant get a web designer, don't use homegrow CSS design if you don't have web designer, use open source CSS/Javascript toolkit like [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap], or [Zurb Foundation][foundation]. It is free, cost nothing except learning curve for fundamental CSS/JQuery (developer must know basic CSS as well right?). Futhermore, a lot of open source components/tools around these frameworks like [JQuery file upload][fileupload] and [Bootsnipp][bootsnipp] can make your life easier. Still feel pain in the ass when design based on these frameworks? Buy a premium theme (from market [Wrapbootstrap][wrapbootstrap]), cost you few bucks but save your developers (or even designer) 1-2 weeks time (do your math!), sometime even more. It is not 2-3 pages of forms, it is a lot, sometime up to 50 pages.### SummaryTeam lead for enterprise application, stop hiding in cave. Go out and read latest technologies news, open sources tools, hacking on weekends.For enterprise company that doing enterprise application development, get a designer or use open source CSS/Javascript toolkits or buy a premium theme.[bootstrap]: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/[foundation]: http://foundation.zurb.com/[fileupload]: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/[bootsnipp]: http://bootsnipp.com/[wrapbootstrap]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/},  {  id    : http://dreamand.me/web/fulltext-search-at-jekyll-site/,  title   : Fulltext Search on Jekyll Site,  content : I power my blog using jekyll, a static blog generator. Recenty I saw a javascript full text search engine, [lunr][lunr] that really awesome. So I integrate into my blog and now my blog have full text search capibility! Awesome! So in this blog I will document and describe how I did it.### Download lunrBefore get started, you need download [lunr][lunr] at https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js and include in your blog js folder.### Index ContentBefore doing full text search, you need to index your blog content. First, create a `post.json` file in `_includes` folder as template to render post document:~~~{  id    : http://dreamand.me{{ post.url }},  title   : {{ post.title }},  content : {{ post.content | strip_html | strip_newlines | remove:''  }}}~~~After that, create a `search.js` at the root of the blog to hold the blog contents:~~~------var docs = [ {% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}  {% include post.json %},{% endfor %}];// init lunrvar idx = lunr(function () {  this.field('title', 10);  this.field('content');})// add each document to be indexfor(var index in docs) {  idx.add(docs[index]);}~~~**Note:** The file must begin with YAML front matter block so it will be processed by Jekyll as special files.Now your blog is index under `idx` object and you can search it. At the end of the documents, create a `lunr` with index fields **title** and **content** to be index.### SearchNow is time to create search capibility using html, javascript. First, include `search.js` and `lunr` js in your site:~~~~~~Is time to create `form` element for user to search, I have created partial `search.html` for display search form:~~~  Search                  GO!      ~~~Finally, add jquery to handle search event, add into `search.js` or other javascript file:~~~$(function() {  $(#search button).click(function() {    search();  });  $(#search input).keypress(function(e) {    if(e.which == 13) {      e.preventDefault();      search();    }  });})function search() {  var result = idx.search($(#search input).val());  if(result &amp;&amp; result.length &gt; 0) {    window.location.replace(result[0].ref);  } else {    alert(Found nothing);  }}~~~### ImprovementCurrently the search is not so user friendly where autocomplete is not available. When I am free I will improve it.### SummaryUsing [lunr][lunr], we able to bring the power of fulltext search to static generated blog, [jekyll][jekyll]. Cool.[lunr]: https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/},];// init lunrvar idx = lunr(function () {  this.field('title', 10);  this.field('content');})// add each document to be indexfor(var index in docs) {  idx.add(docs[index]);}Note: The file must begin with YAML front matter block so it will be processed by Jekyll as special files.Now your blog is index under idx object and you can search it. At the end of the documents, create a lunr with index fields title and content to be index.SearchNow is time to create search capibility using html, javascript. First, include search.js and lunr js in your site:&lt;script src=/js/lunr.min.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=/search.js&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Is time to create form element for user to search, I have created partial search.html for display search form:&lt;div class=minor well shadow&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;Search&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;form&gt;    &lt;div class=input-append&gt;      &lt;input type=search name=q id=q placeholder=Enter keywords.../&gt;      &lt;button class=btn type=button&gt;GO!&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/form&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Finally, add jquery to handle search event, add into search.js or other javascript file:$(function() {  $(#search button).click(function() {    search();  });  $(#search input).keypress(function(e) {    if(e.which == 13) {      e.preventDefault();      search();    }  });})function search() {  var result = idx.search($(#search input).val());  if(result &amp;&amp; result.length &gt; 0) {    window.location.replace(result[0].ref);  } else {    alert(Found nothing);  }}ImprovementCurrently the search is not so user friendly where autocomplete is not available. When I am free I will improve it.SummaryUsing lunr, we able to bring the power of fulltext search to static generated blog, jekyll. Cool."
